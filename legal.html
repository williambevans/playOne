        <p>IN THE COUNTY COURT OF BOSQUE COUNTY</p>

        <p>
            On this day, the undersigned respectfully submits this document outlining concerns regarding
            the handling of legal matters within Bosque County, specifically pertaining to the timeliness
            and procedural adherence in ongoing legal proceedings. It has been 8 months since the undersigned's
            arrest, during which weekly communication with the appointed bail bondsman has been maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite repeated inquiries, critical information regarding the case, including a formal case number
            and assigned court dates, has not been provided. This delay has caused undue stress and raises
            significant concerns regarding the violation of due process rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The undersigned respectfully requests immediate attention to this matter and seeks clarification
            regarding the handling of this case to ensure adherence to the principles of fairness and justice.
        </p>
